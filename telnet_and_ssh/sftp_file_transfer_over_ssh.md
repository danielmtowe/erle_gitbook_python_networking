## SFTP: File Transfer Over SSH

Version 2 of the SSH protocol includes a sub-protocol called the “SSH File Transfer Protocol” (SFTP) that
lets you walk the remote directory tree, create and delete directories and files, and copy files back and
forth from the local to the remote machine. The capabilities of SFTP are so complex and complete, in
fact, that they support not only simple file-copy operations, but can power graphical file browsers and
can even let the remote filesystem be mounted locally.

When talking about SFTP commands than is provided by the bare `paramiko` documentation for the Python SFTP
client( http://www.lag.net/paramiko/docs/paramiko.SFTPClient-class ) ;
here are the main things to remember when doing SFTP:

- The SFTP protocol is stateful, just like FTP, and just like your normal shell
account. So you can either pass all file and directory names as absolute paths that
start at the root of the filesystem, or use `getcwd()` and `chdir()` to move around the
filesystem and then use paths that are relative to the directory in which you have
arrived.


- You can open a file using either the `file()` or `open()` method and you get back a file-like object
connected to an SSH channel that runs independently of your SFTP channel.


- Because each open remote file gets an independent channel, file transfers can
happen asynchronously; you can open many remote files at once and have them
all streaming down to your disk drive, or open new files and be sending data the
other way.


- Finally, keep in mind that no shell expansion is done on any of the file names you
pass across SFTP. If you try using a file name like * or one that has spaces or
special characters, they are simply interpreted as part of the file name.
This means that any support for
pattern-matching that you want to provide to the user has to be through fetching
the directory contents yourself and then checking their pattern against each one,
using a routine like those provided in [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/2/library/fnmatch.html?highlight=fnmatch#fnmatch) in the Python Standard Library. `fnmatch` module provides support for Unix shell-style wildcards, which are not the same as regular expressions.


A very modest example SFTP session is shown in `sftp.py`. It does something simple that system
administrators might often need: it connects to the remote system and copies messages log files out of the /var/log directory,
perhaps for scanning or analysis on the local machine.
The [functools module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functools.html?highlight=functools#functools) is for higher-order functions: functions that act on or return other functions. In general, any callable object can be treated as a function for the purposes of this module, as shown in the `sftp.py`:

```python

import functools
import paramiko

class AllowAnythingPolicy(paramiko.MissingHostKeyPolicy):
    def missing_host_key(self, client, hostname, key):
        return

client = paramiko.SSHClient()
client.set_missing_host_key_policy(AllowAnythingPolicy())
client.connect('127.0.0.1', username='test')  # password='')

def my_callback(filename, bytes_so_far, bytes_total):
    print 'Transfer of %r is at %d/%d bytes (%.1f%%)' % (
        filename, bytes_so_far, bytes_total, 100. * bytes_so_far / bytes_total)

sftp = client.open_sftp()
sftp.chdir('/var/log')
for filename in sorted(sftp.listdir()):
    if filename.startswith('messages.'):
        callback_for_filename = functools.partial(my_callback, filename)
        sftp.get(filename, filename, callback=callback_for_filename)

client.close()
```

Note that, although I made a big deal of talking about how each file that you open with SFTP uses its
own independent channel, the simple `get()` and `put(`) convenience functions provided by paramiko—
which are really lightweight wrappers for an `open()` followed by a loop that reads and writes—do not
attempt any asynchrony, but instead just block and wait until each whole file has arrived. This means that
the foregoing script calmly transfers one file at a time, producing output that looks something like this:
```
root@erlerobot:~/Python_files#  python sftp.py
Transfer of 'messages.1' is at 32768/128609 bytes (25.5%)
Transfer of 'messages.1' is at 65536/128609 bytes (51.0%)
