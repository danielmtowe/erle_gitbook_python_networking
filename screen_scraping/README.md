# Screen Scraping
---

Most web sites are designed first and foremost for human eyes. While well-designed sites offer formal
APIs by which you can construct Google maps, upload Flickr photos, or browse YouTube videos, many
sites offer nothing but HTML pages formatted for humans. If you need a program to be able to fetch its
data, then you will need the ability to dive into densely formatted markup and retrieve the information
you needâ€”a process known affectionately as screen scraping.
