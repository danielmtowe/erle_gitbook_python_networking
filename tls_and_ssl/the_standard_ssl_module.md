## The Standard SSL Module


Here you canfind an example of the use of TLS.The first and last few lines of this file `sslclient.py` look completely normal: opening a socket to a remote
server, and then sending and receiving data per the protocol that the server supports. The cryptographic
protection is invoked by the few lines of code in the middleâ€”two lines that load a certificate database
and make the TLS connection itself, and then the call to `match_hostname()` that performs the crucial test
of whether we are really talking to the intended server or perhaps to an impersonator.
```python

import os, socket, ssl, sys
from backports.ssl_match_hostname import match_hostname, CertificateError

try:
    script_name, hostname = sys.argv
except ValueError:
    print >>sys.stderr, 'usage: sslclient.py <hostname>'
    sys.exit(2)

# First we connect, as usual, with a socket.

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
sock.connect((hostname, 443))

# Next, we turn the socket over to the SSL library!

ca_certs_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(script_name), 'certfiles.crt')
sslsock = ssl.wrap_socket(sock, ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3,
                          cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_REQUIRED, ca_certs=ca_certs_path)

# Does the certificate that the server proffered *really* match the
# hostname to which we are trying to connect?  We need to check.

try:
    match_hostname(sslsock.getpeercert(), hostname)
except CertificateError, ce:
    print 'Certificate error:', str(ce)
    sys.exit(1)

# From here on, our `sslsock` works like a normal socket.  We can, for
# example, make an impromptu HTTP call.

sslsock.sendall('GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n')
result = sslsock.makefile().read()  # quick way to read until EOF
sslsock.close()
print 'The document https://%s/ is %d bytes long' % (hostname, len(result))

```
Note that the certificate database needs to be provided as a file named `certfiles.crt` in the same
directory as the script.
```
root@erlerobot:~/Python_files# cat /etc/ssl/certs/* > certfiles.crt
```
```
root@erlerobot:~/Python_files#  sslclient.py www.openssl.org
The document https://www.openssl.org/ is 15941 bytes long
```
