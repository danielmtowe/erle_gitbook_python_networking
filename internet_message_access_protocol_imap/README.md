## Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)

Such as POP, IMAP is a way that a laptop or desktop computer can connect to a larger Internet server to view
and manipulate a userâ€™s e-mail.
Whereas the capabilities of POP are rather anemicthe IMAP protocol offers such a full array of
capabilities that many users store their e-mail permanently on the server, keeping it safe from a laptop
or desktop hard drive crash.

This chapter will teach just the basics, with a focus on how to best connect from Python.
