# Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
---
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) systems let you call a remote function using the same syntax that you
would use when calling a routine in a local API or library. This tends to be useful in two situations:
First, when your program has a lot of work to do, and you want to spread it across several
machines by making calls across the network; and second, when you need data or information that is only available on another hard drive or
network.

In this chapeter we will try to know RCP better and learn how we can use it in combination con Python.
