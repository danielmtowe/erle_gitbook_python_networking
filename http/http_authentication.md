## HTTP Authentication

The HTTP protocol came with a means of authentication that was so poorly thought out and so badly
implemented that it seems to have been almost entirely abandoned. When a server was asked for a page
to which access was restricted, it was supposed to return a response code:
`HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required`.

The authentication token was
generated by doing base64 encoding on the colon-separated username and password:
```python
>>> import base64
>>> print base64.b64encode("guido:vanOranje!")
Z3VpZG86dmFuT3JhbmplIQ==
```
This, of course, just protects any special characters in the username and password that might have
been confused as part of the headers themselves; it does not protect the username and password at all,
since they can very simply be decoded again:
```python
>>> print base64.b64decode("Z3VpZG86dmFuT3JhbmplIQ==")
guido:vanOranje!
```
Anyway, once the encoded value was computed, it could be included in the second request like this:
`Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpvcGVuIHNlc2FtZQ==``

An incorrect password or unknown user would elicit additional 401 errors from the server, resulting
in the pop-up box appearing again and again. Finally, if the user got it right, she would either be shown
the resource or—if she in fact did not have permission—be shown a response code like the following:`403 Forbidden`.

Python supports this kind of authentication through a handler that, as your program uses it, can
accumulate a list of passwords.
```python
auth_handler = .HTTPBasicAuthHandler()
auth_handler.add_password(realm='voetbal', uri='http://www.onsoranje.nl/',
            user='guido', passwd='vanOranje!')
            ```
The resulting handler can be passed into build_opener().
