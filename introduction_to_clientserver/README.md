# Introduction to Client/Server Networking

This chapter is about network programming with the Python language: about accomplishing a specific set
of tasks that all involve a particular technology—computer networks—using a general-purpose
programming language that can do all sorts of things.

For now on, we will use frecuently:
- [Python Standard Library
documentation](http://docs.python.org/library/)
- [Python Package Index](http://pypi.python.org/)
